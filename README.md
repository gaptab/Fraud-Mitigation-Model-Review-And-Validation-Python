# Fraud-Mitigation-Model-Review-And-Validation-Python

This solution validates and benchmarks fraud mitigation models used for credit and debit card transactions. It includes:

✅ Traditional Score-Based Models (Logistic Regression)

✅ Machine Learning (ML) Models (Decision Tree & Random Forest)

✅ Scenario-Based Fraud Detection (Analyzing transaction patterns)

✅ Model Validation (Conceptual soundness, outcome analysis, performance monitoring)

**Data Simulation**

We generate 5,000 synthetic transactions across 500 customers, simulating fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Each transaction has:

Customer ID – Unique identifier

Transaction Amount – High-value transactions often indicate fraud

Transaction Count – Frequent small transactions could signal fraud

Card Type – Either Credit or Debit

Location – To detect anomalies (e.g., unusual country usage)

Merchant Category – High-risk categories like Gambling, Electronics

Previous Fraud Flag – If the customer had past fraudulent transactions

Time of Day – Fraud is more likely at night or unusual hours

Fraud Flag – 98% transactions are legitimate, and 2% are fraudulent (real-world ratio)

**Feature Engineering (Preparing Data for ML Models)**

Before training the models, we:

1️⃣ Convert categorical variables (Card Type, Location, Merchant Category, Time of Day) into numerical values using one-hot encoding.

2️⃣ Scale numerical features (Transaction Amount, Transaction Count) for better ML performance.

3️⃣ Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%) to validate the models.

**Fraud Detection Model Training & Validation**

We use three models to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not:

1️⃣ Logistic Regression (Traditional Score-Based Model)

A baseline fraud detection model using a linear approach.

Assigns a risk score to transactions based on patterns.

Easy to interpret but less effective for complex fraud scenarios.

🔹 Validation Metrics:

✅ Accuracy – Measures correct predictions.

✅ AUC-ROC Score – Measures fraud detection ability.

✅ Precision & Recall – Checks false positive & false negative rates.

2️⃣ Decision Tree Classifier (ML-Based Model)

Non-linear fraud detection model that learns rules like:

"If transaction > $5,000 and in a risky category, flag as fraud."

Captures hidden fraud patterns but may overfit the data.

🔹 Validation Metrics:

✅ Higher precision than Logistic Regression.

✅ Overfitting risk (performance drops on unseen data).

✅ Analyzes variable importance (which features contribute to fraud).

3️⃣ Random Forest Classifier (Best ML Model)

An ensemble model that builds multiple Decision Trees.

More stable & robust than a single Decision Tree.

Used in real-world fraud detection due to high accuracy.

🔹 Validation Metrics:

✅ Best fraud detection performance.

✅ Reduces false positives & false negatives.

✅ Handles large, complex data well.

**Model Validation & Benchmarking**

To evaluate model performance, we compare:

Accuracy (Overall correctness of fraud detection)

Precision (How many flagged transactions are actually fraud)

Recall (Sensitivity) (How well fraud is detected)

AUC-ROC Score (Measures fraud detection performance)

✅ Logistic Regression is simple but lacks predictive power.

✅ Decision Tree performs better but may overfit.

✅ Random Forest offers the best fraud detection, minimizing false positives.

**Performance Monitoring & Future Enhancements**

1️⃣ Threshold Optimization – Adjust fraud detection thresholds to minimize false positives.

2️⃣ Drift Detection – Monitor changes in fraud patterns over time.

3️⃣ Real-World Validation – Compare ML models with traditional fraud detection tools (MANTAS, ACTIMIZE, NORKOM).

4️⃣ Deploy in Real-Time Systems – Integrate ML models into fraud monitoring software.

**Key Takeaways**

✅ ML models significantly enhance fraud detection over traditional risk scoring models.

✅ Random Forest Classifier is the most effective model for reducing fraud.

✅ Benchmarking against existing fraud tools ensures robust validation.

✅ Continuous model monitoring is essential to maintain fraud detection accuracy.
